Running locally

[Documentation](/introduction) [SDKs](/sdks/overview) [Learn](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/category/tutorials) [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction)

Welcome to [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev) ðŸ”¥! Here are some instructions on how to get the project locally so you can run it on your own and contribute.

If youâ€™re contributing, note that the process is similar to other open-source repos, i.e., fork Firecrawl, make changes, run tests, PR.

If you have any questions or would like help getting on board, join our Discord community [here](https://discord.gg/gSmWdAkdwd) for more information or submit an issue on Github [here](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl/issues/new/choose)!

## [â€‹](\#running-the-project-locally)  Running the project locally

First, start by installing dependencies:

1. node.js [instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs)
2. pnpm [instructions](https://pnpm.io/installation)
3. redis [instructions](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-redis/)

Set environment variables in a `.env` file in the `/apps/api/` directory. You can copy over the template in `.env.example`.

To start, we wonâ€™t set up authentication, or any optional sub services (pdf parsing, JS blocking support, AI features)

Copy

```
# ./apps/api/.env

# ===== Required ENVS ======
NUM_WORKERS_PER_QUEUE=8
PORT=3002
HOST=0.0.0.0

#for self-hosting using docker, use redis://redis:6379. For running locally, use redis://localhost:6379
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

#for self-hosting using docker, use redis://redis:6379. For running locally, use redis://localhost:6379
REDIS_RATE_LIMIT_URL=redis://localhost:6379
PLAYWRIGHT_MICROSERVICE_URL=http://playwright-service:3000/html

## To turn on DB authentication, you need to set up supabase.
USE_DB_AUTHENTICATION=false

# ===== Optional ENVS ======

# Supabase Setup (used to support DB authentication, advanced logging, etc.)
SUPABASE_ANON_TOKEN=
SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_TOKEN=

# Other Optionals
# use if you've set up authentication and want to test with a real API key
TEST_API_KEY=
# set if you'd like to test the scraping rate limit
RATE_LIMIT_TEST_API_KEY_SCRAPE=
# set if you'd like to test the crawling rate limit
RATE_LIMIT_TEST_API_KEY_CRAWL=
# set if you'd like to use scraping Be to handle JS blocking
SCRAPING_BEE_API_KEY=
# add for LLM dependednt features (image alt generation, etc.)
OPENAI_API_KEY=
BULL_AUTH_KEY=@
# use if you're configuring basic logging with logtail
LOGTAIL_KEY=
# set if you have a llamaparse key you'd like to use to parse pdfs
LLAMAPARSE_API_KEY=
# set if you'd like to send slack server health status messages
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=
# set if you'd like to send posthog events like job logs
POSTHOG_API_KEY=
# set if you'd like to send posthog events like job logs
POSTHOG_HOST=

# set if you'd like to use the fire engine closed beta
FIRE_ENGINE_BETA_URL=

# Proxy Settings for Playwright (Alternative you can can use a proxy service like oxylabs, which rotates IPs for you on every request)
PROXY_SERVER=
PROXY_USERNAME=
PROXY_PASSWORD=
# set if you'd like to block media requests to save proxy bandwidth
BLOCK_MEDIA=

# Set this to the URL of your webhook when using the self-hosted version of FireCrawl
SELF_HOSTED_WEBHOOK_URL=

# Resend API Key for transactional emails
RESEND_API_KEY=

# LOGGING_LEVEL determines the verbosity of logs that the system will output.
# Available levels are:
# NONE - No logs will be output.
# ERROR - For logging error messages that indicate a failure in a specific operation.
# WARN - For logging potentially harmful situations that are not necessarily errors.
# INFO - For logging informational messages that highlight the progress of the application.
# DEBUG - For logging detailed information on the flow through the system, primarily used for debugging.
# TRACE - For logging more detailed information than the DEBUG level.
# Set LOGGING_LEVEL to one of the above options to control logging output.
LOGGING_LEVEL=INFO

```

### [â€‹](\#installing-dependencies)  Installing dependencies

First, install the dependencies using pnpm.

Copy

```bash
# cd apps/api # to make sure you're in the right folder
pnpm install # make sure you have pnpm version 9+!

```

### [â€‹](\#running-the-project)  Running the project

Youâ€™re going to need to open 3 terminals for running the services. Here is [a video guide accurate as of Oct 2024](https://youtu.be/LHqg5QNI4UY) (optional: 4 terminals for running the services and testing).

### [â€‹](\#terminal-1-setting-up-redis)  Terminal 1 - setting up redis

Run the command anywhere within your project

Copy

```bash
redis-server

```

### [â€‹](\#terminal-2-setting-up-workers)  Terminal 2 - setting up workers

Now, navigate to the apps/api/ directory and run:

Copy

```bash
pnpm run workers
# if you are going to use the [llm-extract feature](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl/pull/586/), you should also export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-______

```

This will start the workers who are responsible for processing crawl jobs.

### [â€‹](\#terminal-3-setting-up-the-main-server)  Terminal 3 - setting up the main server

To do this, navigate to the apps/api/ directory. If you havenâ€™t installed pnpm already, you can do so here: [https://pnpm.io/installation](https://pnpm.io/installation)

Next, run your server with:

Copy

```bash
pnpm run start

```

### [â€‹](\#optional-terminal-4-sending-our-first-request)  _(Optional)_ Terminal 4 - sending our first request

Alright, now letâ€™s send our first request.

Copy

```curl
curl -X GET http://localhost:3002/test

```

This should return the response Hello, world!

If youâ€™d like to test the crawl endpoint, you can run this

Copy

```curl
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/v0/crawl \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
      "url": "https://docs.firecrawl.dev"
    }'

```

## [â€‹](\#tests)  Tests:

The best way to do this is run the test with `npm run test:local-no-auth` if youâ€™d like to run the tests without authentication.

If youâ€™d like to run the tests with authentication, run `npm run test:prod`
