## [â€‹](\#welcome-to-firecrawl)  Welcome to Firecrawl

[Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev?ref=github) is an API service that takes a URL, crawls it, and converts it into clean markdown. We crawl all accessible subpages and give you clean markdown for each. No sitemap required.

## [â€‹](\#how-to-use-it)  How to use it?

We provide an easy to use API with our hosted version. You can find the playground and documentation [here](https://firecrawl.dev/playground). You can also self host the backend if youâ€™d like.

### [â€‹](\#api-key)  API Key

To use the API, you need to sign up on [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev) and get an API key.

### [â€‹](\#features)  Features

- [**Scrape**](/introduction#scraping): scrapes a URL and get its content in LLM-ready format (markdown, structured data via [LLM Extract](/introduction#extraction), screenshot, html)
- [**Crawl**](/introduction#crawling): scrapes all the URLs of a web page and return content in LLM-ready format
- [**Map**](/features/map): input a website and get all the website urls - extremely fast

### [â€‹](\#powerful-capabilities)  Powerful Capabilities

- **LLM-ready formats**: markdown, structured data, screenshot, HTML, links, metadata
- **The hard stuff**: proxies, anti-bot mechanisms, dynamic content (js-rendered), output parsing, orchestration
- **Customizability**: exclude tags, crawl behind auth walls with custom headers, max crawl depth, etcâ€¦
- **Media parsing**: pdfs, docx, images.
- **Reliability first**: designed to get the data you need - no matter how hard it is.
- **Actions**: click, scroll, input, wait and more before extracting data

You can find all of Firecrawlâ€™s capabilities and how to use them in our [documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev)

## [â€‹](\#crawling)  Crawling

Used to crawl a URL and all accessible subpages. This submits a crawl job and returns a job ID to check the status of the crawl.

### [â€‹](\#installation)  Installation

Python

Node

Go

Rust

Copy

```bash
pip install firecrawl-py

```

### [â€‹](\#usage)  Usage

Python

Node

Go

Rust

cURL

Copy

```python
from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp

app = FirecrawlApp(api_key="fc-YOUR_API_KEY")

# Crawl a website:
crawl_status = app.crawl_url(
  'https://firecrawl.dev',
  params={
    'limit': 100,
    'scrapeOptions': {'formats': ['markdown', 'html']}
  },
  poll_interval=30
)
print(crawl_status)

```

If youâ€™re using cURL or `async crawl` functions on SDKs, this will return an `ID` where you can use to check the status of the crawl.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "id": "123-456-789",
  "url": "https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/crawl/123-456-789"
}

```

### [â€‹](\#check-crawl-job)  Check Crawl Job

Used to check the status of a crawl job and get its result.

Python

Node

Go

Rust

cURL

Copy

```python
crawl_status = app.check_crawl_status("<crawl_id>")
print(crawl_status)

```

#### [â€‹](\#response)  Response

The response will be different depending on the status of the crawl. For not completed or large responses exceeding 10MB, a `next` URL parameter is provided. You must request this URL to retrieve the next 10MB of data. If the `next` parameter is absent, it indicates the end of the crawl data.

Scraping

Completed

Copy

```json
{
  "status": "scraping",
  "total": 36,
  "completed": 10,
  "creditsUsed": 10,
  "expiresAt": "2024-00-00T00:00:00.000Z",
  "next": "https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/crawl/123-456-789?skip=10",
  "data": [\
    {\
      "markdown": "[Firecrawl Docs home page![light logo](https://mintlify.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/firecrawl/logo/light.svg)!...",\
      "html": "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\" class=\"js-focus-visible lg:[--scroll-mt:9.5rem]\" data-js-focus-visible=\"\">...",\
      "metadata": {\
        "title": "Build a 'Chat with website' using Groq Llama 3 | Firecrawl",\
        "language": "en",\
        "sourceURL": "https://docs.firecrawl.dev/learn/rag-llama3",\
        "description": "Learn how to use Firecrawl, Groq Llama 3, and Langchain to build a 'Chat with your website' bot.",\
        "ogLocaleAlternate": [],\
        "statusCode": 200\
      }\
    },\
    ...\
  ]\
}\
\
```\
\
## [â€‹](\#scraping)  Scraping\
\
To scrape a single URL, use the `scrape_url` method. It takes the URL as a parameter and returns the scraped data as a dictionary.\
\
Python\
\
Node\
\
Go\
\
Rust\
\
cURL\
\
Copy\
\
```python\
from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp\
\
app = FirecrawlApp(api_key="fc-YOUR_API_KEY")\
\
# Scrape a website:\
scrape_result = app.scrape_url('firecrawl.dev', params={'formats': ['markdown', 'html']})\
print(scrape_result)\
\
```\
\
### [â€‹](\#response-2)  Response\
\
SDKs will return the data object directly. cURL will return the payload exactly as shown below.\
\
```json\
{\
  "success": true,\
  "data" : {\
    "markdown": "Launch Week I is here! [See our Day 2 Release ðŸš€](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/launch-week-i-day-2-doubled-rate-limits)[ðŸ’¥ Get 2 months free...",\
    "html": "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\" class=\"light\" style=\"color-scheme: light;\"><body class=\"__variable_36bd41 __variable_d7dc5d font-inter ...",\
    "metadata": {\
      "title": "Home - Firecrawl",\
      "description": "Firecrawl crawls and converts any website into clean markdown.",\
      "language": "en",\
      "keywords": "Firecrawl,Markdown,Data,Mendable,Langchain",\
      "robots": "follow, index",\
      "ogTitle": "Firecrawl",\
      "ogDescription": "Turn any website into LLM-ready data.",\
      "ogUrl": "https://www.firecrawl.dev/",\
      "ogImage": "https://www.firecrawl.dev/og.png?123",\
      "ogLocaleAlternate": [],\
      "ogSiteName": "Firecrawl",\
      "sourceURL": "https://firecrawl.dev",\
      "statusCode": 200\
    }\
  }\
}\
\
```\
\
## [â€‹](\#extraction)  Extraction\
\
With LLM extraction, you can easily extract structured data from any URL. We support pydantic schemas to make it easier for you too. Here is how you to use it:\
\
v1 is only supported on node, python and cURL at this time.\
\
Python\
\
Node\
\
cURL\
\
Copy\
\
```python\
from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp\
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field\
\
# Initialize the FirecrawlApp with your API key\
app = FirecrawlApp(api_key='your_api_key')\
\
class ExtractSchema(BaseModel):\
    company_mission: str\
    supports_sso: bool\
    is_open_source: bool\
    is_in_yc: bool\
\
data = app.scrape_url('https://docs.firecrawl.dev/', {\
    'formats': ['extract'],\
    'extract': {\
        'schema': ExtractSchema.model_json_schema(),\
    }\
})\
print(data["extract"])\
\
```\
\
Output:\
\
JSON\
\
```json\
{\
    "success": true,\
    "data": {\
      "extract": {\
        "company_mission": "Train a secure AI on your technical resources that answers customer and employee questions so your team doesn't have to",\
        "supports_sso": true,\
        "is_open_source": false,\
        "is_in_yc": true\
      },\
      "metadata": {\
        "title": "Mendable",\
        "description": "Mendable allows you to easily build AI chat applications. Ingest, customize, then deploy with one line of code anywhere you want. Brought to you by SideGuide",\
        "robots": "follow, index",\
        "ogTitle": "Mendable",\
        "ogDescription": "Mendable allows you to easily build AI chat applications. Ingest, customize, then deploy with one line of code anywhere you want. Brought to you by SideGuide",\
        "ogUrl": "https://docs.firecrawl.dev/",\
        "ogImage": "https://docs.firecrawl.dev/mendable_new_og1.png",\
        "ogLocaleAlternate": [],\
        "ogSiteName": "Mendable",\
        "sourceURL": "https://docs.firecrawl.dev/"\
      },\
    }\
}\
\
```\
\
### [â€‹](\#extracting-without-schema-new)  Extracting without schema (New)\
\
You can now extract without a schema by just passing a `prompt` to the endpoint. The llm chooses the structure of the data.\
\
cURL\
\
Copy\
\
```bash\
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape \\
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \\
    -d '{\
      "url": "https://docs.firecrawl.dev/",\
      "formats": ["extract"],\
      "extract": {\
        "prompt": "Extract the company mission from the page."\
      }\
    }'\
\
```\
\
Output:\
\
JSON\
\
```json\
{\
    "success": true,\
    "data": {\
      "extract": {\
        "company_mission": "Train a secure AI on your technical resources that answers customer and employee questions so your team doesn't have to",\
      },\
      "metadata": {\
        "title": "Mendable",\
        "description": "Mendable allows you to easily build AI chat applications. Ingest, customize, then deploy with one line of code anywhere you want. Brought to you by SideGuide",\
        "robots": "follow, index",\
        "ogTitle": "Mendable",\
        "ogDescription": "Mendable allows you to easily build AI chat applications. Ingest, customize, then deploy with one line of code anywhere you want. Brought to you by SideGuide",\
        "ogUrl": "https://docs.firecrawl.dev/",\
        "ogImage": "https://docs.firecrawl.dev/mendable_new_og1.png",\
        "ogLocaleAlternate": [],\
        "ogSiteName": "Mendable",\
        "sourceURL": "https://docs.firecrawl.dev/"\
      },\
    }\
}\
\
```\
\
### [â€‹](\#extraction-v0)  Extraction (v0)\
\
Python\
\
JavaScript\
\
Go\
\
Rust\
\
cURL\
\
Copy\
\
```python\
\
app = FirecrawlApp(version="v0")\
\
class ArticleSchema(BaseModel):\
    title: str\
    points: int\
    by: str\
    commentsURL: str\
\
class TopArticlesSchema(BaseModel):\
top: List[ArticleSchema] = Field(..., max_items=5, description="Top 5 stories")\
\
data = app.scrape_url('https://news.ycombinator.com', {\
'extractorOptions': {\
'extractionSchema': TopArticlesSchema.model_json_schema(),\
'mode': 'llm-extraction'\
},\
'pageOptions':{\
'onlyMainContent': True\
}\
})\
print(data["llm_extraction"])\
\
```\
\
## [â€‹](\#interacting-with-the-page-with-actions)  Interacting with the page with Actions\
\
Firecrawl allows you to perform various actions on a web page before scraping its content. This is particularly useful for interacting with dynamic content, navigating through pages, or accessing content that requires user interaction.\
\
Here is an example of how to use actions to navigate to google.com, search for Firecrawl, click on the first result, and take a screenshot.\
\
It is important to almost always use the `wait` action before/after executing other actions to give enough time for the page to load.\
\
### [â€‹](\#example)  Example\
\
Python\
\
Node\
\
cURL\
\
Copy\
\
```python\
from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp\

app = FirecrawlApp(api_key="fc-YOUR_API_KEY")\
\
# Scrape a website:\
scrape_result = app.scrape_url('firecrawl.dev',\
    params={\
