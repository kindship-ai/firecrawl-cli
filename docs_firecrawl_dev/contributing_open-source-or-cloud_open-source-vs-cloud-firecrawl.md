Open Source vs Cloud

[Documentation](/introduction) [SDKs](/sdks/overview) [Learn](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/category/tutorials) [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction)

Firecrawl is open source available under the [AGPL-3.0 license](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl/blob/main/LICENSE).

To deliver the best possible product, we offer a hosted version of Firecrawl alongside our open-source offering. The cloud solution allows us to continuously innovate and maintain a high-quality, sustainable service for all users.

Firecrawl Cloud is available at [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev) and offers a range of features that are not available in the open source version:
